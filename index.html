            <p><b>What makes deep learning in medical and imaging informatics different from applications that are more
              consumer-facing?</b>
              This is healthcare and healthcare, itself, is fundamentally different from every other industry. People assign the highest priority to their health (or lack thereof), expect the highest levels of care and service regardless of cost and are more emotional and ideological about this industry than any other. Because it consumes 17.5% of US GDP and still does not meet societal expectations, it is the most regulated aspect of American society.</p>
